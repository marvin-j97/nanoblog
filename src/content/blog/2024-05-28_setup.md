# Setup repository

## Clone and install repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/marvin-j97/nanoblog your-site-name
cd your-site-name
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

## Start development server

```sh
pnpm dev
```

## Build and preview your site

```sh
pnpm build
pnpm preview
```

The resulting `dist` folder will contain your website.

# Basic configuration

All configuration is done through the _src/config.ts_ file.

There are some essential configuration options that you should definitely look into. In your code editor of choice, simply search for "_SETUP:_", that will show you a list of configurations that require your attention.

## Remove examples

If you want to get rid of the example posts, you can run:

```sh
rm -rf src/content/blog/*.md
```

# Create new blog post

To create a new blog post, simply run:

```sh
pnpm post:create "My First Post"
```

Note how every blog post is prefixed by its Date (YYYY-MM-DD). This helps keeping a chronological order in the file tree, however it is not strictly required. The post's slug can be directly set in the posts _frontmatter_ section.
